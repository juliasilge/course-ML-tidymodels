Notes: You tuned model hyperparameters for a decision tree (cost complexity and tree depth) along with the number of components to use in PCA for data preprocessing. The resulting decision tree (shown here) exhibits some sensible behavior, with the first principal component being the variable for the first split, etc.

# Predicting age

```r
final_tree <- final_wf %>%
  last_fit(sisters_split) 

final_tree %>%
  collect_metrics()
```

```out
# A tibble: 2 x 3
  .metric .estimator .estimate
  <chr>   <chr>          <dbl>
1 rmse    standard      14.0  
2 rsq     standard       0.236
```

The performance metrics you achieved on the testing set indicate that you did not overfit during the tuning process.

# Predicting age

- **Build** your model with your training data
- **Choose** your model and model hyperparameters with your validation data
- **Evaluate** your model with your testing data

Notes: You divided your data into three subsets: a training set to train your model, a validation set to tune hyperparameters, and then a testing set to evaluate the performance of your model and estimate how it will do with new data.

You can also use a validation set to choose between different models.

# Diverse data, powerful tools

- Fuel efficiency of cars ðŸš—
- Developers working remotely in the Stack Overflow survey ðŸ’»
- Voter turnout in 2016 ðŸ—³
- Catholic nuns' ages based on beliefs and attitudes â›ª

Notes: This analysis was just the final example in the series of predictive projects you approached in this course. 

You learned how to go from raw data to exploring that data to training models to evaluating those models using the [tidymodels](https://github.com/tidymodels) metapackage and important tools for exploratory data analysis from the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem, like dplyr and ggplot2.

#  Practical machine learning

- Dealing with class imbalance
- Measuring performance with resampling (bootstrap, cross-validation)
- Tuning hyperparameters

Notes: In this course, I've chosen to spend our energy and time on some of the issues that I have found to be the most important and most impactful from my real world, practical predictive modeling experience. These include knowing what to do when you are faced with class imbalance, having some options in your toolkit for resampling approaches, and optimizing model hyperparametrs.

Notes: To keep going in your machine learning journey, check out the resources at [`tidymodels.org`](https://www.tidymodels.org/). This site is a central location for resources and documentation for tidymodels packages, and there is a ton to explore and learn. ðŸš€

There are five articles at [**Get Started**](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/) that guide you through what you need to know to use tidymodels, and many more resources at [**Learn**](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/).

# Practical machine learning

- Try out multiple modeling approaches for each new problem 
- Overall, [gradient tree boosting and random forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05070v1) ðŸŒ³ perform well

Notes: The high level takeaways that you should remember from this course are first, that each time you have a new predictive modeling problem you are working on, you need to try out multiple different kinds of models. You don't know ahead of time which kind of model is going to perform best. This paper linked here uses some super interesting analysis to show that most often, the two kinds of models that perform best are gradient tree boosting and random forest. 

However, depending on how much data you have and the specifics of your problem, that may not be true, so you have to try it for yourself. Also, start with a **simple model** to compare to.

# Never skip exploratory data analysis âœ…



Notes: And perhaps most importantly, never skip exploratory data analysis when you build machine learning models. It is time well spent, because when you understand a data set better, you can do a better job of building accurate models that perform better.

# Go train some models!

Notes: And that's our ultimate goal here! Thanks for spending time with me on this course. Now it's time for you to take what you've been practicing here and go apply it in the real world.
